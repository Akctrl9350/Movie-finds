        <p1>The Goat Life, also titled Aadujeevitham (transl.â€‰Goat life) in Malayalam, is an upcoming survival drama film written, directed, and co-produced by Blessy. The film is an international co-production involving companies in India and the United States, and features dialogues in Malayalam and Arabic languages. It is an adaptation of the 2008 Malayalam novel Aadujeevitham by Benyamin, which is based on a true incident. The film stars Prithviraj Sukumaran as Najeeb, a Malayali immigrant labourer who finds himself forced into slavery as a goatherd on a secluded farm in Saudi Arabia.</p1>
        <p2><li>The film was in development hell since 2009. Blessy wanted to adapt Aadujeevitham ever since he read the novel in 2008. Prithviraj was cast in the same year. In 2009, Blessy signed the deal with Benyamin and began writing the screenplay. However, budget constraints prevented substantial progress. Blessy spent years searching for a producer, finally finding one in 2015, allowing the project to gain momentum. Jimmy Jean-Louis and Steven Adams also joined as producers, along with Blessy himself. A. R. Rahman composed the film's original score and songs.
        <li>Principal photography took place in phases between March 2018 and July 2022 through six schedules in the deserts of Wadi Rum, Jordan and the Sahara, Algeria, with some scenes shot in Kerala, India. The crew was stranded in Jordan desert for 70 days from March to May 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic's restrictions. They were eventually repatriated to India via the Indian government's evacuation programme, Vande Bharat Mission. The film, shot in 3D, concluded filming on 14 July 2022.<p2>
