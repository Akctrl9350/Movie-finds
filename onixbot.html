        <h1>Malayalam superstar Mammootty officially announced his film with director Vysakh on Tuesday. The film, which will be his third collaboration with the director, has been titled Turbo. The first poster from the film that showed a bloody punch is raising the curiosity of the fans.Mammootty has earlier worked in Vysakh in films Pokkiri Raja and Madhura Raja. Besides acting in it, the actor is also producing the film under his banner Mammootty Kampany. He took to Twitter to announce the movie, as he wrote in the caption, “Presenting The Title Poster of Our Fifth Production Venture.”The film, written by Midhun Manuel Thomas will go on floors from Tuesday (October 24). The official Twitter handle of the film posted its first tweet as, “Title Look Poster #Turbo – Directed by Vysakh & Written By Midhun Manuel Thomas Produced by @MKampanyOffl Get ready to feel the real power as we pack our best punch…The shoot starts today. Stay tuned for further updates.”Mammootty’s fans were thrilled with the announcement on the auspicious day of Dussehra and expressed their joy in the comment section. Many of them commented, “All the best,” while others wrote how eagerly they are waiting for this film.Earlier, there were several reports that Turbo is a sequel of Mammootty’s 1990 action comedy film Kottayam Kunjachan along with added information that the film will be titled Adi Pidi Jose. However, in an earlier interview with Asianet News, the actor had denied these claims. He said, “Adi Pidi Jose is not the title of the film, and neither it has any connection with the character I played in Kottayam Kunjachan.”Turbo will be edited by Shameer Muhammed with music by Justin Varghese. The film’s action director will be Phoenix Prabhu. The rest of the cast is yet to be announced.</h1>
